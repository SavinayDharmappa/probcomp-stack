probcomp-stack: MIT Probabilistic Computing Project software stack

Currently bundled as a docker image, derived from components developed
in separate Git repositories and distributed via Ubuntu .deb packages
in <https://github.com/probcomp/packaging>.

To use, pick a directory where you want notebooks to go, say
/path/to/notebooks -- perhaps under your home directory on your
laptop, or perhaps the mount point of an Elastic Block Store on your
Amazon EC2 instance:

% docker build -t probcomp/stack:20170503-0 -f docker/ubuntu1604 .
% mkdir /path/to/notebooks
% docker run --rm --publish 127.0.0.1:8080:8080/tcp \
    -v /path/to/notebooks:/notebook \
    probcomp/stack:20170503-0

Then point a web browser at

http://127.0.0.1:8080/

(Beware: All other processes in the system with access to the TCP/IP
stack, including those running with credentials other than yours, can
reach your jupyter notebook.)

Dockerfiles available:

docker/ubuntu1604
        Ubuntu 16.04 with system packages and probcomp stack

docker/ubuntu1604-jupyter
        Ubuntu 16.04 with system packages, probcomp stack, and pypi jupyter

The version of jupyter on pypi is newer than the version of ipython
notebook in Ubuntu 16.04, but the level of QA and reliability on any
particular base system such as Ubuntu 16.04 is unpredictable.
