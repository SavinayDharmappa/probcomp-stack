<h1>
probcomp-stack-0.2
</h1>

This is probcomp-stack-0.2, released on 19 July 2017.  Blah blah one
sentence description of what this is blah blah <a href="https://jupyter.org/">jupyter notebooks</a> blah blah.

<p>
[QUESTION: what is this thing to be called, exactly, and what is its
version number?  The 'alpha' documented 
<a href="https://probcomp-1.csail.mit.edu/stack/">here</a> is
called variously 'probcomp stack' or 'stack 0.1'.]

<h2>
Before you start
</h2>

<p>
This is research software.  It is certain to contain bugs.  No warranty of any kind
is implied by this release.  Use it at your own risk.

<p>
The installation requires some level of technical ability,
specifically the ability to use the command line, and to install
prerequisite software if required.

<h3>Hardware requirements</h3>

The notebooks in this release have successfully executed with the
following hardware configuration, with acceptable performance:

<ul>
  <li> 60G RAM
  <li> 32 CPU cores
</ul>

<p>
Running with much less than this may lead to heavy load, long
delays, and/or crashes. Actual application demands vary depending on the
particulars of the data set, both its size and the data itself.

<p>
We assume that you are using a workstation possessing the recommended
resources via the workstation's monitor and keyboard.
Client/server configurations are possible for this software, 
and some of you will be able to figure out how to configure it in this way.
This subject beyond the scope of the present document.


<h3>Software prerequisistes</h3>

<p>
probcomp-stack-0.2 has been tested on ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS, but we
anticipate that it will run on any operating system that supports
<a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>, such as most GNU/Linux variants and Mac OS X.

<p>
probcomp-stack-0.2 requires <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> version 6 or later.
</p>

<p>
You will need an unzip program, specifically unzip, winzip, or
similar; one of these is built in to most operating systems,
and may automatically launch on download.

<h2>Download and installation</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Download <a href="probcomp-stack-full-0.2.zip">the stack 0.2 distribution</a> (370 MB).</p>

    <p>Optional: To check the integrity of the download, the SHA256
checksum is 79183671ab39c8625c49fab668069013e763b790054707febd95bc90eaa31391.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>If the file has not been unzipped automatically on download, unzip it using WinZip or similar.
    The result will be a single file, probcomp-stack-full-0.2.tar,
    and may be placed wherever you like.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>How to run</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      At the command line, navigate to the directory containing
      probcomp-stack-full-0.2.tar.
      Start the Docker container as follows:</p>

    <pre><code> $ docker load --input probcomp-stack-full-0.2.tar
 $ docker run --rm --publish 127.0.0.1:8080:8080/tcp \
     probcomp/stack-release:0.1</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a web browser, visit the location <a href="http://localhost:8080/">http://localhost:8080/</a></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
[QUESTION: Is the <code>docker load</code> step really part of
installation, in that it only has to run once at install time?  I
don't understand how this works.  But if this is so,
the <code>load</code> step should be documented as part of
installation, not under 'how to run'.]

<p>
[QUESTION: Is the application self-explanatory from that point that
the home web page comes up?  Need to check.]

<p>
In the unlikely even port 8080 is unavailable on your machine, feel free to choose a
different port.

<h3>Saving your work</h3>

To save any changed or new notebooks, use either 'Save and checkpoint'
or 'Download' in the Jupyter notebook 'File' menu.
